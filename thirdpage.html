            <h1 class="history-header">When did people start using cars?</h1>
            <p>
              In 1904, there were only 23,000 cars on the roads! And six years
              later, there were over 100,000!
            </p>
            <p>
              Before cars, people had to use horses and carriages to move
              around! That wasn't the only way to get around though!
            </p>
            <p>
              From the National Archives: The 1890s saw a phenomenal growth in
              the popularity of cycling, with around 50,000 people employed in
              the manufacture of bicycles. For the first time in history, the
              bicycle provided the ordinary man and woman with an affordable
              means of private transport. As the social reformers Sidney and
              Beatrice Webb wrote in The Story of the King's Highway, published
              in 1913, 'It was not until after 1895 that the world at large took
              to bicycling…the bicycle was a comparatively cheap machine and its
              users were mostly the young people, and, to a great extent, the
              poorer sections of the community'.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h1>It wasn't an overnight change to cars though!</h1>
            <p>
              From the National Archives: It has been estimated that there were
              about 3 ¼ million horses at work in Britain in 1901. About half of
              these were used on farms, but over a million were used
              commercially, to pull goods traffic, buses and trams or hackney
              carriages for hire. More goods were delivered by horse - an
              estimated 671 million tons - than by rail. All this was not
              displaced overnight by the 'horseless carriage'. Indeed, until
              1950, there were still more horses than tractors on British farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, 1901 was a decisive year for bus transport in
              London. At the beginning of the year, all bus services in London
              were still horse-drawn. Traffic jams were a major problem and it
              was thought by contemporaries that motor transport would help the
              situation.
